# Marketing-Campaign-Analysis

## PROBLEM
A Portuguese bank had conducted a telemarketing campaign to encourage its customers to invest their money in the Bank's term-deposit product. The Bank was not satisfied with the campaign and wanted an independent consulting firm to help them use data to predict which customers to market the term deposit to and provide further recommendations. 

## PROJECT GOAL
This report aims to analyze the results of the bank's telemarketing campaign, develop a model to predict the client's likelihood to subscribe to a term deposit, and provide recommendations to make future marketing campaigns more effective.
